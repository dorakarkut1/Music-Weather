"""Current Weather

This script based on location gets and returns current weather: pressure, humidity, weather description, sunrise and sunset time.

This script requires that 'requests', 'json', 'pytemperature', 'time', 'typing' be installed within the Python
environment you are running this script in. It also requires module get_api_number 
from Music_Weather repository.

This file can also be imported as a module and contains the following
functions:

    * timestamp2time - based on timestamp return an hour
	* current_weather - based on location returns current_pressure, current_humidity, weather_description, weather_description_id,sunrise,sunset
